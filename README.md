Here's a professional and demure version of the `README.md` file for the MedFlow API project:

# MedFlow API

MedFlow is a healthcare management API that streamlines the process of managing patient information, appointments, and electronic medical records (EMR). This project was developed as a collaboration between **Godprevail Eseh** and **Ojeh Henry**, with the aim of providing a robust and scalable solution for healthcare providers.

## Features

- **User Management**: Handles the creation, authentication, and role-based management of users, including patients, doctors, and admins.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Enables patients to book appointments with doctors and view appointment history.
- **Electronic Medical Records (EMR)**: Automatically creates EMR for patients following a successful appointment, allowing doctors to update and view patient records.
- **Appointment History**: Tracks and logs past appointments and their related details for easy access.
- **EMR Deletion**: Provides functionality to delete a patient's EMR when necessary.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy for ORM)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access
- **ORM Tooling**: SQLAlchemy for database modeling and Alembic for migrations
- **Testing**: Pytest for automated testing
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment in a containerized environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.x
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medflow-api.git
   cd medflow-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file and define the following variables:
     ```plaintext
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/medflow_db
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     ALGORITHM=HS256
     ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
     ```

4. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the automated tests using `pytest`:
```bash
pytest
```

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication

- **Signup**: `/auth/signup` (POST)  
  Allows new users to sign up.

- **Login**: `/auth/login` (POST)  
  Authenticates users and provides a JWT token.

### Appointments

- **Create Appointment**: `/appointments` (POST)  
  Allows patients to book appointments.

- **View Appointments**: `/appointments` (GET)  
  Retrieves a list of appointments for the logged-in user.

### Electronic Medical Records (EMR)

- **View EMR**: `/emr/{patient_id}` (GET)  
  Allows doctors to view a patient’s medical record.

- **Update EMR**: `/emr/{patient_id}` (PUT)  
  Allows doctors to update the EMR of a patient.

- **Delete EMR**: `/emr/{emr_id}` (DELETE)  
  Allows deletion of a patient’s EMR.

## Deployment

The API can be deployed using Uvicorn. To ru the app, execute the following commands:

1. Start the app:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
The API can also be deployed using Docker. To build and run the Docker container, execute the following commands:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t medflow-api .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 medflow-api
   ```
